[Roof Games Case Unity.pdf](https://github.com/betty-gures/RoofGamesDemo/files/9963435/Roof.Games.Case.Unity.1.pdf)

The test project is in the form of a game inspired by “Space Invaders”. Unity version must be 2019.4.20.
The purpose of the game:

• We have the ship at the bottom of the screen, it moves as you touch the left and right of the screen.
• Ship fires several times per second, bullets move towards enemy ships
• Enemy spaceships are lined up on the screen and they are approaching the player over time. Enemy
ships are destroyed in contact with bullets.

Game controls:

Movement of the ship to the right and left with the arrow keys. Shooting with the space key.
Desired features:

• While developing the game, we expect you to write easily understandable and developable code that
is compatible with the basic game design pattern concepts. This is really important.
• Object pool must be used.
• Graphics are not important; you can find them anywhere and use them.
• A unique feature (e.g., When pressing the “A” key, the bullets you shoot for 5 seconds will not be
destroyed on the first enemy ship it hits, and will destroy all ships along the way.) (Usable only onetime).
