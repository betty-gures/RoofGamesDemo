# Requirements 

[Roof Games Case Unity.pdf](https://github.com/betty-gures/RoofGamesDemo/files/9963435/Roof.Games.Case.Unity.1.pdf)

The test project is in the form of a game inspired by “Space Invaders”. Unity version must be 2019.4.20.

## The purpose of the game:


• We have the ship at the bottom of the screen, it moves as you touch the left and right of the screen.

• Ship fires several times per second, bullets move towards enemy ships

• Enemy spaceships are lined up on the screen and they are approaching the player over time. Enemy
ships are destroyed in contact with bullets.


## Game controls:


Movement of the ship to the right and left with the arrow keys. Shooting with the space key.
Desired features:


• While developing the game, we expect you to write easily understandable and developable code that
is compatible with the basic game design pattern concepts. This is really important.

• Object pool must be used.

• Graphics are not important; you can find them anywhere and use them.

• A unique feature (e.g., When pressing the “A” key, the bullets you shoot for 5 seconds will not be
destroyed on the first enemy ship it hits, and will destroy all ships along the way.) (Usable only onetime).
